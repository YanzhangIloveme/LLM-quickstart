Their idea of vintage is a one year old pair of True Religion jeans.

I asked her if she knew of any \\\"vintage\\\" clothing stores in the area, not getting the dig she said, \\\" I think there are some downtown on Main st.\\\".  I happened to spot another place further south on Maryland pkwy called Mustang Xchange at 4800 s. Maryland pkwy.  I brought my items in and the girl there informed me the owners were not in but she looked at my items an told me the owner would definitely be interested in them and asked me to bring them back in. Buffalo Exchange needs to eliminate the \\\"vintage\\\" in their description and get a location in the mall because thats really where they want to be. Stop pretending to be something you are not.
